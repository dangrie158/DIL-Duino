A complete Arduino environment in a DIL-8 form factor based on the DigiSpark Hardware

## Summary

DIL-Duino uses the QFN Version of the ATTiny85 and a USB Bootloader to provide the easy to use Arduino stack in a single DIL-8 Package Footprint. 
To fit the Micro-USB socket on the board, it was necessary to make the actual board bigger than the DIL Package, but after development the Board is perforated to break the USB Socket and get the desired footprint. 

The pinout matches the ATTiny85 so it can be used as a drop-in replacement
